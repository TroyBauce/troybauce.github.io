    "text": "A year ago, I took a course on personnel psychology (also known as industrial psychology). That course was mostly about hiring practices and methods of measuring people’s work performance. The professor would talk quite a bit about cool hiring methods outside of the standard job interview. An example being a practical test, where applicants would perform job tasks and would be rated on how well they did. This seems like an interesting method of comparing applicants that wouldn’t encourage deceptive behavior from said applicants (such is the case with interviews). However, I have rarely seen in the workforce. This is what made me think about the relationship between organizations and research related to them.\nThis seems to be a common issue in the field of I/O (industrial/organizational) psychology, where organizations have access to knowledge on effective practices, yet don’t implement it. In many cases, the proposed changes are found to increase productivity from employees. Such is the case with the 4 day work week. Research consistently shows that implementing a 4 day work week improves many different things, chief among them being gross domestic product. Being less restrictive on employees benefits organizations, yet these changes are often tossed aside.\nMoney isn’t really a factor in this since the 4-day work week increases the amount that organizations can obtain. One explanation therefore is that the people in charge of businesses are incompetent or ignorant. While this is a tempting explanation, it can’t be the explanation for every organization. The explanation I prefer is that business leaders desire more power over employees, or at least the feeling that they have power over employees. The more accurate explanation is probably a combination of both of these. After all, there are instances of a business leader implementing beneficial policies in order to increase their own power (such as Henry Ford). Malice and incompetence being the cause of bad things isn’t exactly a novel explanation, but it is a fairly consistent one."
